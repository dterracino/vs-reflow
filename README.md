# Reflow

A Visual Studio extension for reflowing a paragraph of text. Simply select one
or more lines of text in the editor and select **Edit** > **Advanced** >
**Reflow Selection** or press **Ctrl+K**, **Ctrl+Q**. This reformats all the
words such that line breaks are removed from short lines and new line breaks are
inserted before words that cause the line to exceed 80 characters. Initial white
space is preserved and prepended to each line. If nothing is selected, the
current paragraph is formatted.

The preferred line length can be changed under **Tools** > **Options** >
**Environment** > **Reflow**.
